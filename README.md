# Task-2 - Brainwave Matrix Solutions

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of Task 2 for Brainwave Matrix Solutions.
The goal is to perform Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

## 🚀 Tools and Libraries Used
Python 🐍
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

## 🛠️ Project Workflow
### 1. Importing Libraries
Essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning were imported.

### 2. Data Loading
The dataset Twitter Sentiments.csv was loaded and explored using Pandas.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
Removal of special characters, mentions (@usernames), hashtags, and extra spaces.

Lowercasing text and removing stopwords using NLTK.

Tokenization and text cleaning for better model performance.

### 4. Feature Engineering
Text data vectorized using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

### 5. Model Building
Built a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment prediction.

### 6. Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model using classification report (precision, recall, f1-score).

Created a confusion matrix to visualize prediction results.

Visualized sentiment distribution with bar charts.

## 📊 Results
Achieved high classification performance across positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

Demonstrated the importance of text preprocessing in NLP pipelines.

## 🧠 Learnings
Importance of data preprocessing in NLP tasks.

Building a simple yet powerful text classification model.

Hands-on experience with TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, and evaluation metrics.

Data visualization to interpret machine learning results.
